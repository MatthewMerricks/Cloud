                                                    WINDOWS SDK RELEASE NOTES

02/25/2013 CloudSDK-v0.1.5.zip
  o Bug fix: CI000052 Extra folder is created in Windows 8 host while a folder is getting copied from sync box (exists in SampleApp).
  o Bug fix: Eliminated a warning message when building the sample app.  Changed the SQL CE assembly version to 4.0.0.1 to match the requirement on the unmanaged SQL assemblies.
  o Bug fix: Creating a new file, renaming it, and saving it would sometimes cause the file to be deleted on all devices.
  o Bug fix: Changed all of the HTTP REST responses dealing with metadata.  The server implementation changed.
    - Old properties:
      . count
      . more_items
      . metadata[]
    - New properties:
      . total_count
      . metadata[]
  o Feature: The CLSyncBox.GetSyncBoxUsage method now returns the quota in the "limit" property.
  o Feature: The X-Cld-Client-Version HTTP header sent on all requests now includes the OS version information of the SDK as well as any ClientVersion the application may have placed in settings.
  o Feature: Added a new public API CLSyncEngine.QueryFileChangeByEventId which returns a FileChange given and event ID.  The event ID is included in the engine status with uploading and downloading file status.

02/18/2013 CloudSDK-v0.1.4.zip
  o Feature: Added support for plans.
  o Feature: Added support for Server-Sent-Events (SSE).  Removed WebSockets support.  The default is now SSE, with fall-back to manual polling.
  o Feature: Implemented all of the non-"file/folder one-off" HTTP REST methods in CLSyncBox and CLCredential.
  o (Breaking change) Changed the signature of the CLCredential.AddSyncBoxOnServer() method to add the optional planID.
  o Bug fix: In the sample app's main window, the textbox for entering a custom device id was too wide and stretched outside it's visible area, reduced the width to align with other fields.
  o Bug fix: Fixed the high-CPU bug occurring with network monitoring events in NetworkMonitor.cs.
  o Bug fix: Fixed all references to settings TraceLocation and TempDownloadsFolder to allow values of null or String.Empty.

02/11/2013 CloudSDK-v0.1.3.zip

  o Feature: Switched to the api.cloudstaging.com URL and routes.
  o Feature: All of the MDS public non-"file/folder one-off" APIs have been implemented.  The /1/sync/sync_box/create and /1/sync/sync_box/list APIs were also implemented.
  o Feature: There is now a setting "BadgingEnabled" that can be used to enable or disable badging.  This setting can be set via a sample program checkbox on the Advanced Options dialog.  Badging must be installed and enabled before badges will appear.
  o Bug fix: Badging was not working properly on Windows 8 systems.
  o Known issue: Push notification: A temporary platform issue is causing the WebSockets support to be unavailable.  This release of the Windows SDK supports only WebSockets and manual polling, so there will always be
    fallback to manual polling until the platform issue is fixed, or until Server-Sent-Events is implemented in the Windows SDK.  Manual polls occur randomly from 30 to 60 seconds.  Therefore, you may notice that syncs are slow to occur on other devices.
  o Known issue: Paths with Windows-restricted characters or extended UTF-8 encoded characters will not sync, and same paths with only case-sensitivity differences may overwrite local files.
  o Known issue: Paths longer than 259 characters will not sync (FAT-32 limit).

02/04/2013 CloudSDK-v0.1.2.zip
  o The sample program now supports a "red X" icon that will display on fatal errors when the sync engine cannot logically continue.  This fatal error summary status condition was
    already being returned in previous builds, but never set by the engine.  The proper response to this error is to stop and restart sync.
  o Fixed a bug: Badges were sometimes displayed or not depending on the path used to launch the Explorer window (e.g: Favorites shortcut or Explorer address line).
  o Added an engine message to indicate that badging initialization failed and badging will not be available. 

01/28/2013 CloudSDK-v0.1.02e37c3.zip
  o (API Breaking Changes): Changed some of the class and method names to be more consistent with the Mac OS X SDK.
    - Renamed CLCredentials to CLCredential.
    - Renamed CLCredential.ApplicationKey to CLCredential.Key.
    - Renamed CLCredential.ApplicationSecret to CLCredential.Secret.
    - Changed the access modifiers of CLCredential.Secret and CLCredential.Key from public to internal.
    - Renamed CLSyncBox.CreateAndInitializeExistingSyncBox to CLSyncBox.CreateAndInitialize.
    - Renamed CLSyncEngine.ShutdownSchedulers CLSyncEngine.Shutdown.
    - Renamed CLSyncEngine.GetCLSyncCurrentStatus to CLSyncEngine.GetEngineCurrentStatus().
  o Added an internal CLCredential.Token property.
  o Added a public helper method "bool CLCredential.CredentialHasToken()".
  o Added some more documentation to CLCredential.
  o Added Cloud server connectivity monitoring.  This halts CLSyncEngine with new halted status if the Cloud servers are out of service for too long.
  o Completed uploads/downloads now properly clear out of the sample app sync status window, and are properly counted.
  o Fixed a badging issue where parent folders were badged "syncing" when all of the contents were badged "synced".
  o The sample app SyncBox folder Browse button now starts the browse in the user's desktop directory.
  o Reworked the CloudApiPublic  Intellisense XML file to remove internal references.
  o Added more comments to CLSyncEngine.GetEngineCurrentStatus.
  o KillTimer is now disposed when it's calculated to not be needed anymore on processing of aggregating status for GetEngineCurrentStatus.
  o Added min height/width to AdvancedOptionsView in the sample app.
  o Fixed a bug on Win8 that disabled the Metro interface when the user clicked Finish on the installer with the Launch Application checkbox checked.
  o Added a WindowsSdkReleaseNotes.txt file in the installation directory, with a Start Menu shortcut to launch it.
  o Changed the installer to launch the SDK documentation rather than the sample app.
  o Fixed an unhandled exception thrown from CLSyncEngine.Start() when the assembly containing CloudApiPublic was loaded from an unmanaged application.
  o WebSocket support works properly now (no fall-back to polling).
  o Fixed a bug.  Push notification was unique only to the SyncBoxId.  It is now unique to the combination of SyncBoxId and DeviceId.
  o Re-tested across all operating systems supported (XpSp3X86, XpSp2X64, VistaX86, VistaX64, Win7X86, Win7X64, Win8X86, Win8X64) 
      for three user types (Built-in Administrator, user in Administrator group, normal user).  Tested installation, uninstall,
	  badging installation, badging uninstall and syncing.
  o Added a "Reset Sync" button to the sample app to reset the sync engine.
  o Fixed an unhandled exception that would occur if BadgeCom.dll is not properly installed.
  o Fixed a problem in CLSyncEngine.Start() that would return a path error when the settings were provided as ICLSyncSettings, rather than ICLSyncSettingsAdvanced.
  o Tested WebSocket support with and without SSL (ws:// and wss://).
  o Fixed a potential deadlock when stopping sync.
  o Added session token support.
  o Refactored the sample app code to refer to Secret (instead of ApplicationSecret), and Key (instead of ApplicationKey).
  o Increased the maximum number of up/downloads from two to six each.
