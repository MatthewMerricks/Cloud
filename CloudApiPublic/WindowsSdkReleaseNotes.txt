01/28/2013 Build 1 (CloudSDK-v0.1.xxxxx.zip)
  o (API Breaking Changes): Changed some of the class and method names to be more consistent with the Mac OS X SDK.
    - Renamed CLCredentials to CLCredential.
    - Renamed CLCredential.ApplicationKey to CLCredential.Key.
    - Renamed CLCredential.ApplicationSecret to CLCredential.Secret.
    - Changed the access modifiers of CLCredential.Secret and CLCredential.Key from public to internal.
    - Renamed CLSyncBox.CreateAndInitializeExistingSyncBox to CLSyncBox.CreateAndInitialize.
    - Renamed CLSyncEngine.ShutdownSchedulers CLSyncEngine.Shutdown.
    - Renamed CLSyncEngine.GetCLSyncCurrentStatus to CLSyncEngine.GetEngineCurrentStatus().
  o Added an internal CLCredential.Token property.
  o Added a public helper method "bool CLCredential.CredentialHasToken()".
  o Added some more documentation to CLCredential.
  o Added Cloud server connectivity monitoring.  This halts CLSyncEngine with new halted status if the Cloud servers are out of service for too long.
  o Added Local Internet connectivity monitoring, with graceful recovery on reconnection.
  o Added long timer recovery of repeated FileChange failures.
  o Completed uploads/downloads now properly clear out of the sample app sync status window, and are properly counted.
  o Fixed a badging issue where parent folders were badged "syncing" when all of the contents were badged "synced".
  o The sample app SyncBox folder Browse button now starts the browse in the user's desktop directory.
  o Reworked the CloudApiPublic  Intellisense XML file to remove internal references.
  o Added more comments to CLSyncEngine.GetEngineCurrentStatus.
  o KillTimer is now disposed when it's calculated to not be needed anymore on processing of aggregating status for GetEngineCurrentStatus.
  o Added min height/width to AdvancedOptionsView in the sample app.
  o Fixed a bug on Win8 that disabled the Metro interface when the user clicked Finish on the installer with the Launch Application checkbox checked.
  o Added a WindowsSdkReleaseNotes.txt file in the installation directory, with a Start Menu shortcut to launch it.
  o Changed the installer to launch the SDK documentation rather than the sample app.
  o Fixed an unhandled exception thrown from CLSyncEngine.Start() when the assembly containing CloudApiPublic was loaded from an unmanaged application.
