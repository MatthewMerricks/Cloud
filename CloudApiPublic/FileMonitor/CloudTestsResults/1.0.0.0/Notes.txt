Known bugs:
Can throw errors in other applications that are trying to modify/delete a file that file monitor is reading
Deletion/renaming folders does not modify nor delete contained folder/file paths appropriately
Repeated tests with the same implementations of FileCreation.xsd produce different results (Rename01 and Stream01)
