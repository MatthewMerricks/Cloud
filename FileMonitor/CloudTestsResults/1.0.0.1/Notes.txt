Removed MD5 checksum hashing from FileMonitor (removes file access conflicts with other applications)
Integrated FilePathDictionary: Deletion/renaming folders now triggers callbacks for inner files/inner folders recursively (not handled, see known bugs)
Made Stream01 test work consistently and correctly (4 creates only at correct locations)
Reduced permutations of Rename01 test (and triggers an unhandled callback)

Known bugs:
Deletion/rename callbacks are not handled (need to Dispose inner FileChanges on QueuedChanges, clean from metadata-keyed dictionary, etc.)
Repeated tests with the same implementations of FileCreation.xsd produce different results (Rename01 only, although I noticed it fired a delete callback which may need to be handled)
